# Win Condition
Launch crates into hoops to score points. You start the game with 120 seconds on the clock and your goal is to complete all 30 stages before the timer hits 0.

# Gameplay Mechanics
Press E next to a crate while looking at it to pick it up.
Hold left click to charge up. Release to launch crates in front of you, or a crate you are currently holding. The longer you charge, the further the crate will fly.
You earn points and time for scoring crates. Crates that miss and fall off the main platform give you a time penalty.

# Other
There are 5 different crates each with different weights and sizes. Some crates have special properties.

The enviornment will change as you progress through the stages, which will make the game more interesting and/or difficult.
